TODO:

drag-n-drop: 
	!!Make cards 2D
	✓Card priority. When card is clicked, bring it to front of all other cards.
	-Card goes off screen (limit Card movement to screen)
	-Don't snap center of card to pointer when clicked.
	-Solid border around card when hover/click/in_hand/on_table/etc...
	-Fix sorting order overflow issue (when > 32767 bring card to front stops working)

base-function:
	-Add Hand
	-Add functionality for Decks (draw, shuffle)
	-

cgo-parser:
	✓Get the card assets and instantiate
	✓Fix the object center when it is loaded (centered at bottom left corner) => change pivot
	-Card sprite becomes invisible when pivot is set (other than Vector.zero)
	-Cards go to wrong layer and occasionally have sorting order issues (investigate)
	-Differentiate between Deck/CardGroup/Card/Token
