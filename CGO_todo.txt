TODO:

drag-n-drop: 
	✓Make cards 2D
	✓Card priority. When card is clicked, bring it to front of all other cards.
	✓NullPointerReferences when selected is null but try to get selected.tag/etc. (ie. dragging background gives lots of errors)
	✓Raycast hits should account for sorting order
	✓Card goes off screen (limit Card movement to screen)
	✓Don't snap center of card to pointer when clicked.
	-Solid border around card when hover/click/in_hand/on_table/etc...
	-Fix sorting order overflow issue (when > 32767 bring card to front stops working)

actions-popup:
	✓populate right click menu (create list of actions each time card is selected)
	✓show a right click popup
	BUG: when an object doesn't have tags it doesn't update the operations list (operations list should be empty) //ensure there are tags (even if it's an empty tag) during loadgame validation
	BUG: to get a single card menu, you need to select card (left click) and right click while holding
	BUG: deck isn't deleted when it's empty
	BUG: if there's an error in the popup (like network issues) then every popup after that only shows "Close"
	
base-function:
	!Add functionality for Decks (draw, shuffle), Cards (turn over)
	-Networking
	-Add Hand (private cards/permissions system)

games-list:
	-Scroll bar in case games exceed screen space (either width or height)
	-Make display prettier

cgo-parser:
	✓Get the card assets and instantiate
	✓Fix the object center when it is loaded (centered at bottom left corner) => change pivot
	✓Card sprite becomes invisible when pivot is set (other than Vector.zero)
	!Differentiate between Deck/CardGroup/Card/Token (and load assets into those classes)
	-Error handling (when cgo file isn't in proper format should fail and go to start screen)


optimizations/implementations:
	-Use Physics2D.GetRayIntersectionNonAlloc in CameraScript.cs to get array of hits (doesn't need to alloc results array everytime)
	-Use Queue to keep track of sorted order of cards (deque, enque when Card is picked up)
	-Loads all images in folder at startup (instead only load images when needed) [easy fix]

temp:
	-Sprites can only be 1024x1024 max because of Texture2D initialization.
	-ContentPanel will keep growing vertically as number of operations grow (make scrollable list)
	-When card leaves the frame, it gets snapped back to (0, 0)
	-Intersection of operations requires the operation names & descriptions to be the same as well (ie, "delete cards" != "delete decks")

networking:
	-Sync all card movements (BUG: card can only be moved by owner. when owner disconnects, all cards disappear (maybe good because already implements permissions system for us))
	-Separate card visibilities & operations (based on permission system) for each player
	-Show every player's cursor on screen (so you see where your opponent is hovering)
	-Lobby system for server selection, game selection, and deck building.
	-How to connect multiple players (sync all variables (deck list<cards>, tags), ensure the properties.cgo file is exactly the same (hash validation with host))

deck-builder:
	-Build another file other than properties that contains premade decks for use ingame (properties.cgo will tell whether to use a standard deck or whether player must enter deck select)

chat:
	-create a chat system for people to post links/communicate while playing the game
