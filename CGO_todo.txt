TODO:

drag-n-drop: 
	✓Make cards 2D
	✓Card priority. When card is clicked, bring it to front of all other cards.
	-NullPointerReferences when selected is null but try to get selected.tag/etc. (ie. dragging background gives lots of errors)
	-Raycast hits should account for sorting order
	-Card goes off screen (limit Card movement to screen)
	-Don't snap center of card to pointer when clicked.
	-Solid border around card when hover/click/in_hand/on_table/etc...
	-Fix sorting order overflow issue (when > 32767 bring card to front stops working)

actions-popup:
	✓populate right click menu (create list of actions each time card is selected)
	✓show a right click popup
	BUG: when an object doesn't have tags it doesn't update the operations list (operations list should be empty) //ensure there are tags during loadgame validation
	BUG: click propogates onto the board
	BUG: clicking doesn't destroy the ContentPanel
	BUG: to get a menu, you need to select card (left click) and right click while holding
	
base-function:
	!Add functionality for Decks (draw, shuffle), Cards (turn over)
	-Add Hand
	-Networking

cgo-parser:
	✓Get the card assets and instantiate
	✓Fix the object center when it is loaded (centered at bottom left corner) => change pivot
	✓Card sprite becomes invisible when pivot is set (other than Vector.zero)
	!Differentiate between Deck/CardGroup/Card/Token (and load assets into those classes)
	-Error handling (when cgo file isn't in proper format should fail and go to start screen)


optimizations/implementations:
	-Use Physics2D.GetRayIntersectionNonAlloc in CameraScript.cs to get array of hits (doesn't need to alloc results array everytime)
	-Use Queue to keep track of sorted order of cards (deque, enque when Card is picked up)

temp:
	-Sprites can only be 1024x1024 max because of Texture2D initialization.


chat:
	-create a chat system for people to post links/communicate while playing the game
